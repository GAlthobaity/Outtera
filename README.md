# Project Description: 
General Entertainment Authority works to benefit from global experiences in 
enriching local content, promoting a culture of Joy, and working to enable the Kingdom 
to become one of the top 10 international centres for large entertainment events, with 
all the various entertainment options available.

Initially, our idea is based on the objectives of the Entertainment Authority in 
providing unique events with international standards to enrich the experience of 
individuals. We are introducing a special application for booking unique adventures for 
a distinctive and interesting experience.

Nature that we see on television is far different in the real world. Direct 
association with nature has both mental and physical benefits. So, the only way to 
experience nature to the fullest is to step out of the door.
Outtera, is an application to arrange group trips for various outdoor activities, 
such as hiking, skydiving, camping, and scuba diving. The users get to choose the 
adventure they want and complete their data to get their tickets.
